## Project Overview
The **Smart Urban Mobility Management System (SUMMS)** is a unified platform designed to integrate multiple urban mobility services into a single system.  
It enables users to search for shared vehicles, reserve rentals, complete payments, and return vehicles, while also providing administrative tools for vehicle management and analytics.

This project focuses on defining a **clear system architecture**, **key use cases**, and **interaction flows** to ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to future mobility service integrations.
